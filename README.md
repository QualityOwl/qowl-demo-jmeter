## Requirements

The following requirements exist for running Apache JMeter:

  If required, these should be downloaded and placed in the lib directory
  - JDBC - available from the database supplier
  - JMS - available from the JMS provider

## Running JMeter

1. Change to the `bin` directory
2. Run the `jmeter` (Un\*x) or `jmeter.bat` (Windows) file.

### Windows

For Windows, there are also some other scripts which you can drag-and-drop
a JMX file onto:

- `jmeter-n.cmd` - runs the file as a non-GUI test
- `jmeter-n-r.cmd` - runs the file as a non-GUI remote (client-server) test
- `jmeter-t.cmd` - loads the file ready to run it as a GUI test

The documentation available as of the date of this release is
